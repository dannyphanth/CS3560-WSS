## 📖 Overview
**Wilderness Survival System (WSS)** is a turn-based survival game built with **Python Arcade**.  
The player must cross a randomly generated wilderness map — moving from west to east — while managing **food, water, strength, and gold**.  
Along the way, they’ll encounter different terrains, collect items, and trade with unpredictable traders.
